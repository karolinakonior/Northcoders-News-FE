NORTHCODERS NEWS

Northcoders News serves as a front-end project designed to provide efficient access to application data through programming. Its primary aim is to emulate the construction of a functional backend service, much like Reddit, enabling fundamental operations such as browsing and organizing articles by topic. Additionally, it facilitates user interactions such as logging in, commenting, and voting on articles. Leveraging the Northcoders News API backend, which I personally developed, this project demonstrates the practical application of full-stack development. Crafting an application that replicates the intricate functionalities of a platform like Reddit presents both challenges and opportunities for learning. Maintaining a well-integrated and effective communication between the frontend and backend components is crucial for delivering a seamless user experience, especially when undertaking a project of this magnitude.
